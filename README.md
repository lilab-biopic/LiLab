## Welcome to Li Lab @ BIOPIC

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Research Interest

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=xVy1jCUAAAAJ).

### We are hiring!

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/skyjasonli/lab/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
