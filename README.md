## Research Interest

![Image](san-diegos-best-trails-top-hikes.jpg)



We will commit to use single-cell multi-omics and functional genomics to examine the mechanisms and functions of epigenetic modifications, 3D genome organization, and non-coding cis-regulatory elements in regulating gene expression, which will be the foundation to further understand gene regulation in cell fate decision, embryo development, and its dysregulation in variety of human diseases.

## We are hiring!

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/skyjasonli/lab/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
