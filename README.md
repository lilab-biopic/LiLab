## Research Interest

![Image](model.jpg)

We commit to use single-cell multi-omics and functional genomics to examine the mechanisms and functions of epigenetic modifications, 3D genome organization, and non-coding cis-regulatory elements in regulating gene expression, which will be the foundation to further understand gene regulation in cell fate decision, embryo development, and its dysregulation in variety of human diseases.
